# IDI Motors Dealer Portal

The staff back office for **IDI Motors** and the API behind the customer website ([car-web](../car-web)).

- **Inventory**: vehicles with photo galleries (Cloudinary), publishing, featured flags, reserved and sold status.
- **CRM**: leads pipeline, appointments (including website test-drive requests), sales, customers, reports and CSV exports.
- **Messaging**: a shared inbox for customer conversations. Customers write from the website and reply from a private link. Staff replies are delivered by email (Resend), with optional SMS and WhatsApp alerts (Twilio).
- **Authentication**: staff email and password sign-in (NextAuth credentials, bcrypt, JWT sessions). There are two roles, admin and staff, plus lockout after repeated failures and an audit log.
- **Preferences**: a display-currency toggle that uses admin-managed exchange rates (base currency ZMW), and a language switcher (English, Français, Português, Kiswahili).

## Architecture

```
car-web (customer site, :3000) ──► /api/public/*  (CORS-restricted, rate-limited, no auth)
                                         │
car-web-portal (staff UI, :3001) ──► /api/*  (session required, role-checked)
                                         │
                                     MongoDB  ·  Cloudinary  ·  Resend  ·  Twilio
```

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app/` | Pages (dashboard, `admin/[section]`, `messages`, `admin/settings`, `login`) and API routes |
| `components/dealer/` | Portal UI: shell, sections, record forms, inbox, settings |
| `lib/domain.ts` | Shared Zod schemas, types and helpers (single source of validation) |
| `lib/database/` | Mongoose connection and models |
| `lib/server/` | Auth, HTTP helpers (errors, CORS, rate limiting), data mappers, conversations, messaging |
| `lib/client/` | Browser API client, workspace store (polling), preferences and i18n |
| `proxy.ts` | Route protection: redirects pages to `/login` and returns 401 for private APIs |

## Getting started

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and a MongoDB database (Atlas works).

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3001
```

1. Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. The first sign-in creates that admin account if no staff exist yet. Afterwards, remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the environment and manage the team in **Settings → Team**.
2. Under **Inventory**, an empty database offers **Load sample inventory** so the website has something to show.
3. Start the customer site (`../car-web`, port 3000) with `NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL=http://localhost:3001`.

Scripts: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm start` (port 3001), `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`.

> If `mongodb+srv://` fails with `querySrv ECONNREFUSED`, the machine's DNS is refusing SRV lookups. Set `DNS_SERVERS=8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1`.

## Environment variables

See [.env.example](./.env.example) for the full annotated list. Without these values the portal still runs:

| Variable | Missing / placeholder behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL` | Emails are skipped (messages still show in the inbox and on the customer thread) |
| `TWILIO_*` | SMS and WhatsApp alerts are skipped |
| `CLOUDINARY_*` | Uploads are disabled; staff can still paste `https://` image URLs |

**Settings → Messaging status** shows which channels are active.

## API

All responses are JSON. Errors use the shape `{ "error": "message" }`, with status codes 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429 and 5xx.

### Public (website)
Allowed origins come from `CLIENT_ORIGINS`.

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/public/vehicles` | Query: `q`, `make`, `body`, `fuel`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `featured=1`, `sort` (`featured`, `newest`, `price-low`, `price-high`, `recent`), `page`, `limit` (max 100). Returns `{ vehicles, total, page, pages, makes }`. Lists only published vehicles that are not sold. |
| GET | `/api/public/vehicles/:slug` | Returns `{ vehicle, related }` |
| GET | `/api/public/settings` | Dealership name, contact details, base currency and rates |
| POST | `/api/public/enquiries` | `{ name, email, phone?, message, vehicleSlug? }`. Creates a lead and a conversation, emails the customer a private thread link, and alerts staff. |
| POST | `/api/public/appointments` | `{ name, email, phone?, vehicleSlug?, date: YYYY-MM-DD, time: HH:MM, type, notes? }`. Creates a **Requested** appointment for staff to confirm. |
| GET / POST | `/api/public/conversations/:token` | Reads the thread, or posts `{ body }` as the customer |
| POST | `/api/public/uploads` | Multipart `file` (JPG/PNG/WebP/AVIF, up to 8 MB). Uploads a customer photo to `${CLOUDINARY_FOLDER}/trade-ins` and returns `{ url }`. |
| POST | `/api/public/trade-ins` | `{ type: "Sell" \| "Swap", name, email, phone, make, model, year, mileage, fuel, transmission, body, color?, condition, askingPrice?, targetVehicleSlug?, notes?, images[1–12] }`. Creates a trade-in request plus a lead and conversation, and returns `{ token, threadUrl }`. |

The forms include a `website` honeypot field. Public endpoints are rate-limited per IP.

### Staff (session cookie required)
- `GET /api/workspace` returns everything the dashboard needs, including the signed-in user (`me`).
- CRUD:
  - `/api/vehicles[/:id]`
  - `/api/leads[/:id]`: a PATCH with only `{ stage }` changes the stage.
  - `/api/appointments[/:id]`: a PATCH with only `{ status }` changes the status.
  - `/api/sales`: recording a sale marks the vehicle Sold and the lead Won.
- Inbox:
  - `/api/conversations`
  - `/api/conversations/:id`: opening a conversation marks it read; a PATCH sets `{ status }`.
  - `/api/conversations/:id/messages`: POST a reply.
- `POST /api/upload`: multipart `file`, JPG/PNG/WebP/AVIF up to 8 MB. Vehicles take up to 12 photos; the admin uploads several in parallel and resizes them in the browser.
- Trade-ins (sell to us / swap & top-up):
  - `GET /api/trade-ins`
  - `PATCH /api/trade-ins/:id` with `{ status?, offer?, staffNotes? }`. Use DELETE (admin only) to remove a request.
  - `POST /api/trade-ins/:id/inventory`: once a request is Accepted, creates an unpublished vehicle with its photos.
- `POST /api/account/password` changes your own password.
- Admin only:
  - `/api/settings`, plus `POST /api/settings/rates` to refresh live rates.
  - `/api/staff[/:id]`: add members, change role, activate or deactivate, reset passwords.
  - `GET /api/audit`
  - `POST /api/seed`: sample inventory, only when the database is empty.
- `GET /api/health` reports database status (for uptime checks).

## Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (cost 12). After 5 failed sign-ins an account is locked for 15 minutes, and sign-in attempts are rate-limited per IP.
- Sessions are 12-hour JWTs in an httpOnly cookie with a portal-specific name, so they don't clash with other apps on `localhost`. Each API request re-checks that the account is still active and re-reads its current role.
- Customer conversation tokens are stored only as SHA-256 hashes plus an AES-GCM sealed copy derived from `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. Rotating the secret invalidates existing customer links.
- All input is validated with Zod and CSV exports are protected against formula injection. Security headers are set in `next.config.ts`: frame denial, nosniff, referrer policy, permissions policy, and HSTS in production.
- The rate limiter is in memory and therefore per instance. When running multiple instances, put a shared limiter (for example Redis) or the platform's WAF in front.
